# uber-microservice-go

This repository imitates Uber's Go microservice architecture based on the GopherCon 2019 talk session `How Uber "Go"es`.

## NOTICE

I haven't worked on Uber so this repository *imitates* does not *reproduce* the Uber way.
Some parts of this repository are different from that.
I **DON'T** guarantee the correctness.

If you're a member of Uber and have some suggestions or fixes, it would be happy for you to give me something.
